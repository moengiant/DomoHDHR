HDHomerunIconsSimple.py

TO USE:
Place the script in the script/python directory
Install any modules needed using pip 
Edit the IP on line 81 to match the IP address of the HDHomehomerun device and the IP of you Domoticz server on line 97
Run the script
This will take a liitle while to run - all depends on number of channels
When the script has finished running restart Domoticz to refreash the switch icons list 

WHAT IT DOES: 
This file will do a couple of things in order to get Domoticz ready in order to use the the HDHomerun.py script

1) It will scrap the HDHomerun channel images and create channel icons - XXXChannel.png, XXXChannel48_On.png and XXXChannel48_Off.png
move icons to the www/images directory (XXX is the channel number)

2) It will append the switch_icons.txt file with the icon data - XXXChannel;XXXChannel;XXX Channel Logo


HDHomerun.py

TO USE: 
Create a switch device for each turner - write down the idx's of the new devices
Edit the tunerIDs list with the idx's of the devices just created
As well edit the IP address of your HDHomerun device in the script -lines 8 and 30
Edit the IP address and port of your Domoticz server on lines 67,70,76 and 78

Now run the script as a service or time script and the devices will be updated when HDHomerun tuners are in use
