2) It will import the images into the CustomImages table of the Domoticz database (A retart of Domoticz in necessary in order for the customicons to be usable the web gui)
3) It will append the switch_icons.txt file with icon data
4) It will move icons to the www/images directory

To use check to make sure all modules needed are install in python using pip
Place the scripts in the scritps/python directory using IDEL of run HDHomerunIcons.py 
This will take a liitle while to run - all depends on number of channels

When the scripts has finished running restart Domoticz 
Now create a switch device for each turner - write down the idx's of the new devices
Edit the tunerIDs list with the idx's of the devices just created
As well edit the IP address of your HDHomerun device in the script -lines 8 and 30
